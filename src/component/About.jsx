          I am Ramya, a passionate and hardworking fresher eager to begin my
          career in web development. I have a strong foundation in front-end
          technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, which enables
          me to build responsive and interactive websites. In addition to my
          technical skills, I am proficient in using Bootstrap for styling,
          GitHub for version control, and Figma for designing user-friendly
          interfaces.

          I also have basic knowledge of Python and PHP, allowing me to explore
          backend development as well. While I may not have professional
          experience, I am a quick learner, a problem-solver, and deeply
          motivated to contribute to real-world projects. I am excited to apply
          my skills and grow as a developer.
